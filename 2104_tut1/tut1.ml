(* 
 Q1. Consider the expression below
*)
 
  let x = 2 in
  let y = 3 in
  let x = x * 4 in
  print_endline ("Q1 Ans = "^(string_of_int (x+y))) ;;
  

(* Which x is being referenced in the last line?
   What output will be printed? *)

(*
Q2. Consider the expression below
*)
 
  let x = 2 in
  let y = let x = x * 4 in 3 in
  print_endline ("Q2 Ans = "^(string_of_int (x+y))) ;;

(* Which x is being referenced in the last line?
   What output will be printed? *)
  
(* Q3. Consider the function below *)
 
  let foo x = x+1
   
(* What is the type of this function? *)

(* Q4. Consider the function below *)
 
  let goo (x,y) = x
   
(* What is the type of this function? *)


(* Q5. Consider the function below *)
 
  let hoo x y = x
   
(*  
    What is the type of this function? 
	Does this function has the same type as ggo?
	How are the two functions related?
*)


(* Q6. Consider the maxlist function below *)
 
   let rec maxlist xs =
     match xs with
	 | [] -> failwith "empty list"
	 | [x] -> x
	 | x::ys -> 
		let m2 = maxlist ys in
		if x>m2 then x
		else m2 ;;
		
   print_endline ("Q6 Ans (maxlist [3;16;1] = "^(string_of_int (maxlist [3;16;1]))) ;;
   print_endline ("hello");;

(* 
	(i) What is the type of this function?
	(ii) Explain what happen when an empty list is supplied as the input?
    (iii) Is it possible for recursive maxlist ys call to throw an exception?	
*)

(*
  Q7 : Rewrite maxlist function to use an auxiliary recursive
       function, as follows:
*)

  let maxlist2 xs =
     let rec aux xs sofar =
		match xs with
		| [] -> sofar
		| x::ys -> failwith "to be completed"
	in match xs with
	| [] -> failwith "empty list"
	| x::ys -> aux ys x

(*
   How is this function different from the version in Q6
   Is it any better?
*)

(*
  Q8 : The maxlist function currently has type: int list -> int.

  Rewrite it to a version that is based on the following option
  type from the Pervasive standard library:

     type 'a option = None | Some of 'a

*)

  let maxlist3 (xs:int list) : int option =
    failwith "to be completed"
