At which method call did the interpreter paused for some time?

  Q2: Load a more efficient version of fib2 below together with its
	print method. Take note of which call first has an integer overflow.

    flush(stdout)

  Q3: To avoid integer overflow, you can either use the big_int module or
	the following num module .
	
	  type num = 
    |	Int of int
    |	Big_int of Big_int.big_int
    |	Ratio of Ratio.ratio

  http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Num.html
	
	Rewrite fib3 to use num type so that integer overflow does not occur.
	
	From top-level, first #load "nums.cma";; into memory.
	After that, open Num;;

  You may need to use:
	  num_of_int : int -> num
	  string_of_num : num -> string
		+/ : num -> num -> num		
		
	Run print_fib3 to get the first 100 fibs.

  Q4: Implement fibonacci as a tail-recursive method with two
      parameters, initially denoting fib(0) and fib(1).
      Is is computational behaviour different from a Loop?

    if i=n then r1

		(*	failwith "to be implemented with recursive (aux (n-1))"*)

(* 
  Q5: You have been asked to implement a list of factorials.
	A naive way of implementing it is given below. The naive
	algorithm has O(n^2) complexity.
	
  Can you write a more efficient tupled recursive method to do this
  in O(n) time?
	
  To avoid integer overflow, change it to use the num type.

  Q6: Consider a function to enumerate all prefixes of
      a list of elements. Such a function can be written
      using recursion, as follows:
  
*)
let enum_prefix xs = 
  let rec add e xs =
    match xs with
    | [] -> []
    | r::rs -> (e::r)::(add e rs) in
  let rec aux xs =
    match xs with
    | [] -> [[]]
    | e::es -> 
      let rs = aux es in
     (* rs@(add e rs*)
			[]@(add e rs)
  in aux xs;;

let enum_suffix xs = 
	let rs = List.rev xs in
	let ans = List.enum_prefix xs in
	List.map List.rev ans;;

enum_prefix [1;2;3;4];;

enum_prefix [4;-1;2;-9;3];;

(* 
  Q7: Using enum_prefix, write a function
      that would find the largest prefix in a given list.
   What is the time-complexity of this method?

*)
let rec sum xs =
	match xs with
	| [] -> 0
	| x :: xs -> x+(sum xs)
let choose_max xs1 xs2 = 
	let s1= sum xs1 in
	let s2= sum xs2 in
	if s1<s2 then xs2
	else xs1;;

let rec find_max rs =
	match rs with 
	| [a] ->a
	| b::ds -> choose_max b ( find_max ds);;

let max_prefix xs = 
  let rs = enum_prefix xs in
	find_max rs 
  
	failwith "find largest seq in rs";;

(* 
  Q8: Without using enum_prefix, write a
      more efficient max_prefix2 method that would
      return an identical result as max_prefix.

      Using recursion to implement your new method.
      Compare and contrast between these two 
      methods for computing max_prefix.
